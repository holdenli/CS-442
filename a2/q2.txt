Question 2
----------

1.
(define Y-fact
  `(fun s fun x
        ,if (zero? x)
        (incr ,zero)
        (,* x (s (pred x)))
        )
  )
(define fact `(,Y-combinator ,Y-fact))

2.
This will work simply because my evaluator uses NOR.
And for NOR, if there is a normal form then NOR can reach it as stated by the Standardization theorem.
So assuming the above implementation does run using AOE then it will run with my evaluator.

3.
No.
If NOR terminates then the result is in normal form.
If AOE termiantes then the result is in normal form.
By the Church-Rosser Theorem, these results are the same.
